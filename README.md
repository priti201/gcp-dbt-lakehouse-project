# gcp-dbt-lakehouse-project
Production-grade Cloud Lakehouse built using GCS, BigQuery, dbt, and Looker Studio. Implements a full ELT pipeline including cloud storage ingestion, warehouse modeling (staging → intermediate → marts), automated testing, CI/CD workflows, and a live analytics dashboard.
This project showcases a complete cloud analytics pipeline that:
Ingests raw data into Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
Loads and processes data in BigQuery
Transforms data using dbt Core or dbt Cloud
Builds a Lakehouse-style architecture (raw → staging → core models)
Implements orchestration, testing, documentation, and CI/CD
Deploys to the cloud (NOT local only)
This repository is ideal for demonstrating data engineering, analytics engineering, and cloud architecture skills.
